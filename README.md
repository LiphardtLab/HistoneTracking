# HistoneTracking

This repository contains high resolution tracking data for histones inside living cells. 

The overall goal of these experiments is to understand the temporal dynamics of chromatin. 
We explore the temporal dynamics by stochastically expression labeled histones, 
which are incorporated into the chromatin. We then use single molecule TIRF microscopy to 
track those labeled histones. 

We image the cells once every two seconds. Every cell contains between 40 to 180 labelled histones that we track. 
This means that for every cell, we obtain 40-180 XY,T trajectories. These trajectories can then be used to study how the 
chromatin is moving. A basic analysis of these data is presented in Figure 3 of the following preprint:
https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/03/159004.   
 
We have uploaded (1) all raw data, (2) files containing XY,T tracks of single histones, 
and (3) a detailed description of the experiment and our microscope. 
Please let us know if there is anything else you would like us to upload and share.
